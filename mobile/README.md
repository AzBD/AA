# Mobile app for CardDealer technical assignment

## To get started

```
cd ./mobile
npm install
```

## To test the app

We have setup the skeleton of an Expo-based React-Native mobile app. Feel free to not use Expo, but in our experience it makes things much easier. Steps:

- Download the Expo Go app on your phone
- Follow these instructions to connect it to your locally checked out code: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/#opening-the-app-on-your-phonetablet (should ideally be as simple as running `npm run start` and using the QR code to open the Expo Go app)


If everything is working correctly, you should see a simple app with example data fetched from your server. Make sure the server is running at the same time
